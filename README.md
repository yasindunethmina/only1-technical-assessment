## ü§ù Notes on React Aria Implementation

The project utilizes React Aria Components extensively, particularly for tables and form elements, with opportunities for further enhancement:

- Deeper integration with React Aria hooks
- Enhanced usage of Group and Toolbar components
- Additional accessibility improvements

*Note: As React Aria was new to my technology stack, I focused on delivering core functionality while maintaining accessibility standards. Given the two-day time constraint, I prioritized building a robust, working solution that follows best practices. I'm looking forward to exploring more of React Aria's components and hooks capabilities in future projects.*
